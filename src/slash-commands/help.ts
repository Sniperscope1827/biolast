		question: 'How do I play/progress?',
		answer: 'You need to scavenge your region for weapons, armor, and other equipment that could help you survive.' +
			' **To start scavenging, use the `/scavenge` command**. You\'ll be prompted to choose which area in your region you want to scavenge.' +
			' Some areas are patrolled by mobs such as walkers that you\'ll need to kill before you can search that area. **If you\'re' +
			' just starting out, you should stick to the areas that aren\'t guarded so that you can gear up**.\n\nOnce you think you have enough' +
			' gear from scavenging, you can attempt the **boss fight**. Boss fights allow you to team with up to **2** friends to take down a' +
			' powerful mob. **By defeating the boss, you and your friends will unlock a new region to explore**. The regions you unlock will' +
			' have better weapons and gear, as well as more powerful mobs to fight. The boss of each area is different and will require you' +
			' to plan the fight. Use `/boss` to attempt the fight.\n\nFighting bosses and scavenging are the main ways to get gear, but you could also progress by using outside sources' +
			' such as a `/companion`, the `/market`, trading with other players, or the `/merchant`.'
	},
	{
		question: 'How do I level up?',
		answer: `You will gain ${icons.xp_star} **XP** when you scavenge, win fights, or complete quests. **Completing quests is the fastest way to gain XP**.` +
			'\n\nYou can view your level progress by using `/level`, `/profile`, or `/inventory`.'
	},
	{
		question: 'How do I heal?',
		answer: 'While in a duel, you can click the "Use Medical Item" to use a healing item from your inventory.' +
			'\n\nIf you aren\'t in a duel, you can use a medical item to heal with `/heal <item id>`. You will also heal passively for **5 health** every **5 minutes**.'
	},
	{
		question: 'How do I increase storage space?',
		answer: 'You can equip a backpack to increase your inventory space. Backpacks of varying levels can be found from scavenging or bought from the shop.' +
			' Once you have one, simply do `/equip <item id>` to equip the backpack.' +
			'\n\nStash space cannot be altered with backpacks, instead stash space will increase by **5** each time you level up.'
	},
	{
		question: 'Any tips for winning fights?',
		answer: 'If the mob you are planning to fight is wearing armor, be sure to check how good the armor is with `/item info <item name>` and verify' +
			' that the weapon you have will penetrate their armor or at least get close. Armor drastically reduces damage from weapons with a low penetration level.' +
			'\n\nIf you plan on healing during a 1v1 fight, make sure the medical item you are going to use heals for at least more damage than the mob/player will hit you for.' +
			' It\'s pointless to heal using a medical item that doesn\'t heal more than their damage because you will still lose health when they attack you' +
			' (this tip only applies to 1v1 duels, not boss fights where your friends are helping you).' +
			'\n\nIf you plan on using a stimulant, use it at the very start of a fight. Stimulants last the entire duel, so using it after a few turns' +
			' would be a waste.'
	},
	{
		question: 'Complex - How is damage calculated?',
		answer: 'Weapons are classified as either melee or ranged. If your weapon is melee, you can view how much damage it does by checking the item stats: `/item <item name>`' +
			'\n\nIf however you are trying to check how much damage a ranged weapon will deal, you\'ll need to instead check how much damage the **ammo** your using deals. This is because **damage with ranged weapons' +
			' is entirely dependent on the ammo used**.\n\nArmor may also affect how much damage you deal, **if the ammo your using has a lower penetration level than the armor level the target is wearing, your damage will' +
			' be reduced**. If your ammo has a higher penetration level than the armor level your target is wearing, you will deal full damage.\n\nHitting certain body parts will also determine your damage. A hit to the target\'s head' +
			' will deal 1.5x damage (assuming they aren\'t wearing a helmet) but is obviously harder to hit. A hit to the chest will deal normal damage and is the easiest body part to hit.' +
			' A hit to the arms or legs deals half damage but you also avoid hitting any armor the target is wearing. **Your ability to successfully hit a targeted limb is dependent on your' +
			' weapon\'s accuracy.** If your weapon has less than **50%** accuracy, you won\'t be able to target a limb.'
